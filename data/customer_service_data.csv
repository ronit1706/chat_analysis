And, I have a problem every time I use Alitalia. They are famous for switching your seats if they have an Alitalia frequent flyer book after you who asks for your seats. They always give first priority to their own frequent flyers. It's happened to me three times now (most recently 9/14), so they still do it.

My mom and I are going to China next month. While in China, our 4 domestic flights will be on Air China in economy. We are both Star Alliance Gold-equivalent (she thru Miles and More, me thru United). I know we can check in at the business counter, but had a couple of other questions: - Can we use the business lounge before the flights? Or is that only for Air China's own FF Gold pax? - The Air China web site is a little confusing about baggage. I know we are normally allowed one piece of 20 kgs each in economy. What is the extra baggage allowance - is it by weight or piece? - Lastly, is there any chance of our getting upgraded? I usually get upgraded on US domestic flights about 50% of the time, but is that something Air China would keep for its own FF Gold members? To be clear, we are NOT expecting any upgrades, but it sure would be nice if it happened :-) Thanks! And if anyone has traveled Air China domestic recently, do please share your experiences. Our flights are all quite short - 2 hrs or less. Is there food? Personal TV's? Are the seats comfy?"

Breakfast options in T2 don't seem as good for the kids (I supposed this depends on the answer to my first question). 3. Would it be worthwhile booking an Escape lounge in T2 so we could just chill out and have brekkie there before our US flight. We have an early start from Ireland so want to have a really nice breakfast rather than just a pastry and coffee. If kids eat too much rubbish pre-flight we are in trouble. thoughts and recommendations appreciated. Thanks, JJ"

The ONLY thing that is non-negotiable is that we have to be in Salt Lake City on day X for a 7 night coach tour, returning to Salt Lake City for the flight home to the UK. And we may decide to stay an extra day SLC before flying home. Just because we can, we'd like also to spend a week beforehand in Las Vegas (Grand Canyon etc). we are also considering a few days that would mean flying into Cincinnati  I have an assumption in my head that it would be cheaper to fly from the UK to the same US city that we would fly home to rather than open-jaw / multi city. Am I right in thinking this? 2. Based on the above assumption, that it would then be cheaper for me to sort out the internal flights separately as I would then have more choice of airlines incl. the domestic airlines 3. There are too many combinations and it's doing my head in! eg Fly to SLC and from there to LAS to CVG to SLC or...SLC / CVG / LAS / SLC or.... fly from uk to LAS / CVG / SLC or ...hmm, I don't think I want to do UK to CVG as there are no direct flights, I believe. 4. I'm beginning to think LAS / CVG / SLC ( but is it then better to fly back to LAS for the return to the UK, or is the price difference not that great if I fly into one and out from another?) 5. If you have the slightest notion of what I'm going on about, I salute you, and thank you for any thoughts you may have that would help clarify things for me. I think it's just that because outside of the specific coach tour, we have no fixed plans, no fixed timescales and can go here, there and everywhere! I would like to go premium economy (or whisper it; if a sale comes up and we can find a business fare...! I only care about that UK to USA and back again. Don't care where we sit for the internal flights. Many thanks for any thoughts!"
